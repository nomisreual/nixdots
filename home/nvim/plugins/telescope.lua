-- Telescope is a fuzzy finder that comes with a lot of different things that
-- it can fuzzy find! It's more than just a "file finder", it can search
-- many different aspects of Neovim, your workspace, LSP, and more!
--
-- The easiest way to use telescope, is to start by doing something like:
--  :Telescope help_tags
--
-- After running this command, a window will open up and you're able to
-- type in the prompt window. You'll see a list of help_tags options and
-- a corresponding preview of the help.
--
-- Two important keymaps to use while in telescope are:
--  - Insert mode: <c-/>
--  - Normal mode: ?
--
-- This opens a window that shows you all of the keymaps for the current
-- telescope picker. This is really useful to discover what Telescope can
-- do as well as how to actually do it!

-- [[ Configure Telescope ]]
-- See `:help telescope` and `:help telescope.setup()`
require("telescope").setup({
	-- You can put your default mappings / updates / etc. in here
	--  All the info you're looking for is in `:help telescope.setup()`
	--
	-- defaults = {
	--   mappings = {
	--     i = { ['<c-enter>'] = 'to_fuzzy_refine' },
	--   },
	-- },
	-- pickers = {}
	extensions = {
		["ui-select"] = {
			require("telescope.themes").get_dropdown(),
		},
	},
})

-- Enable telescope extensions, if they are installed
pcall(require("telescope").load_extension, "fzf")
pcall(require("telescope").load_extension, "ui-select")

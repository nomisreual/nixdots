# Personal Configuration

It's not my first time running NixOS, and it seems that once you try it, you'll eventually come back. So here I am.

Additionally, I manage my Mac with the same flake. Thus far, only utilising nix darwin (home-manager is planned on my Mac as well).

Going forward I aim for modularity, so I can easily share configurations across machines.
